Hi, I don't know what to write here, so just a few notes of consideration:

As you can see, my name is Shravan Natarajan. If you see any pushes by a "Bavan", that's me (it's an old nickname) pushing to this repository from my PC as opposed to my laptop.

Please do not copy this code directly without my consent (which is probably going to be a yes no matter what). Just please ask first! 

Lastly, I just wanted to mention that the general idea for this was from a video I watched around 7 years ago found here: https://youtu.be/Q8zC3-ZQFJI?si=G9pvzb9SeCSiVWam.
